## Engine concepts/classes to maybe add

1. GameMode
    State machine:  loading, starting, running, stopping, stopped, unloading

## Gameplay logic

Games are implemented in two parts:

1. C++ modules implement gameplay systems.
    They operate on components, react to and emit events, can emit signals and accept signals through slots.
2. Gameplans are visual scripts that connect signals to slots.
    Gameplans are connected to the signal generator of a component:
        eg an entities TriggerRegion's on-enter signal has an attached Gameplan to handle when another entity enters that region.
    Signals can be processed before passing them to slots:
        Adapter nodes to change the signals types or format
        Filter nodes to only let signals with certain data through
        Transform nodes to modify a signal before passing it to a slot.
    Signals are generated by a system, for a source entity.
    Slots are part of the a system and tend to operate on a destination entity, usually to modify the destination entities components in some way.

    Example:
    "Pressure Plate" entity has a TriggerRegion with an on-enter signal.
    "Door" entity has an open-door slot.
    A gameplan is attached to "Pressure Plate".TriggerRegion.on-enter and maps this signal to "Door".open-door
    Now, when a TriggerRegion aware entity enters the "Pressure Plate"'s region, the "Door" will open.

Perhaps add a "Choreographer" script: a textual scripting language to choreograph actions and emit events.
    Not sure if its needed yet. Might also be better as a visual timeline.
    It would have timing of events and actions to trigger and used to script interactions between characters (dialogue etc)
    Could this also be used to manage animation? Audio? Special effects? Bullet hell barrages?

## Task List

1. finish making editor widgets for all the different component data types (vectors, matrices, colors etc)
1. write code generator to automatically make editors for every component
1. implement a signal-slots system, add signals as a data type to components
1. expose slots as nodes in the visual scripting
1. make the "gameplan" node graphs be attached to component signals
1. implement nodes for adapters, filters and transformation of signals before passing them to slots
1. a runtime system for that which plays well with my task system
